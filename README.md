# personal-lms

Personal Library Management System (personal-lms) aims to ease the handling of books at home, work, etc. and tracking of the books we read or reading.

We are managing frontend and backend systems in the same repository for a smooth development process. Backend will be created using FastAPI and Python, and Frontend will be made with React.js and Typescript. Finally, we are using PostgreSQL as database. Also, we want to spice things up by adding a book recommendation system for us to find new books to read! [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) is used for fetching information about books in the backend services.
